# Cyber-Spider
## Background
March 3, 2016

On this day, the students of UCLA's CS 32 with Professors Carey Nachenberg and David Smallberg were assigned their 4th
and last project of Winter 2016. The task was to build a program that would be able to efficiently iterate through
thousands (or trillions) of pieces of log data and detect malicious files and websites. This project stretched our
abilities in efficient algorithms, disk files, and larger data structures such as trees and hash tables.
