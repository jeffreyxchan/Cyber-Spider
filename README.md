# Cyber-Spider
## Description
A C++ program that uses a disk-based hash table in order to detect
and purge malicious entities from telementry log data. It also has
the ability to recognize new malicious entities based on the number of
interactions it has with other known malicious entities.

Algorithms within this program were restricted to certain time complexities.
